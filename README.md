# Twitter_WebMining
Data acquisition is our activity to begin collecting dataset, especially collecting tweets which have McDonald’s 3x Spicy Chicken keyword. Using web scraping method with help of python script and Tweepy library. The keyword used to find the tweets was #mcdonaldsmalaysia. After we collected all of the tweets, we generated the excel and csv files afterwards.

This project uses Twitter as the main data source. The first step involves in having a developer account with Twitter. Once the developer account is created, the second step comprises of creating an app with the necessary details. 
Once the application is created, Access token and Consumer key can be requested. The consumer key and the access token will be able to authenticate the API reference for web mining.

# Creating file
The code to create a dataframe with the Tweets. Once the Tweets were scrapped and the dataframe is created, the excel sheet was created as an output.

We collected the dataset from twitter based on user’s tweets on one of the McDonald’s latest products with the hashtag keyword of #wheregotspicychallenge.
The following tables have ten variables in total, and there will be additional features later. We had to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) to ensure the dataset could be analyzed and appropriately visualize into the dashboard.
